# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We try to support all versions of phpwcms with security fixes if it can be easisly backported. But it's 
recommend to update to a current version. On regular basis the following versions of phpwcms are supported.

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| >= 1.9.25 | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.9.25  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability you can report it by email to <og@phpwcms.org>.

Mostly I am ok with opening an [issue](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/issues) if the vulnerability isn't accessible in the frontend of phpwcms.
