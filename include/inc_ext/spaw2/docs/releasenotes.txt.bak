SPAW Editor PHP Edition
Version 2.0.4
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

This release fixes some outstanding issues like undo/redo functionality in IE, 
CSS classes for table cells, plus many more. It also adds and updates a couple
of language files for bothe core and Spaw File Manager plugin. A couple of new
features were added too.

These are only a few of the many changes in the 2.0.4 release. For a complete
list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes some language files that were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
