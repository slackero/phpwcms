=========

**phpwcms** is a very flexible, fast, robust, customer and developer friendly
but yet powerful web based content management system and cms framework running
under PHP and MySQL/MariaDB. phpwcms is created and maintained by
[Oliver Georgi](http://twitter.com/slackero).

To get started, checkout [phpwcms.org](https://www.phpwcms.org) or the community driven
[HowTo Wiki](https://wiki.phpwcms.org/) (snapshot). Most questions are yet
answered on the [phpwcms support forum](https://forum.phpwcms.org).


Quick start
-----------

Stable releases can be used by cloning the repository, `git clone git://github.com/slackero/phpwcms.git` or
[download the archive](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/releases).

To start with the latest development version use `git clone -b v1.10-dev git://github.com/slackero/phpwcms.git` or
[download the archive](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/archive/refs/heads/v1.10-php8.2-dev-mysql-timestamp.zip).
If you have downloaded the archive instead of `git clone`, un-archive and copy the files to your web
document root or sub folder. Link your browser to the related URL and follow the install instructions.


Upgrade
-------

Before you upgrade your existing installation to v1.10+, please update to the latest v1.9.x release first.
Never forget to backup your database and files before you start the upgrade process.


Server system requirements
--------------------------

**phpwcms** version 1.10.9-dev requires a web server with PHP 8.2 or newer.
and a MySQL/MariaDB database (minimum version 5.6+ or equivalent).


Known problems
--------------

Because of the project history there are several probable problems regarding the database.
MySQL changed the time and date related default values over the last years. Check to setup
the related config values to connect to the database in a more compatible way. MySQL Strict
is no good option. I work on this to [solve the problems](https://github.com/slackero/phpwcms/issues/275)
soon.
